### MlClassifierApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.1.

## Running ml-classifier-app 

## Prerequisites

You will need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to use Angular's cli and node package manager.

Once node.js is installed you can install [Angular CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli) by running

```bash
npm i @angular/cli
```

## Installation
To get started locally, follow these instructions:

2. Once the project is on your local computer, run ``npm install``. This will install/update all library dependencies for ml-classifier-app.
3. Run the app from within the ml-classifier-app directory, using the command ``ng s -o``. This will serve and open ml-classifier-app in your default browser using a local host.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
